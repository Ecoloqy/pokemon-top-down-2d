# Pokemon 2D Game

Web technologies (HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript) + HTML Canvas + Typescript + Tailwind.

## Installation

The application does not require installation, it is ready to run in the browser after downloading the source code and running the index.html file.

## Deploy

There is a Dockerfile in the source code to run the app in a container.

## About project

The project was intended to teach me not so much the basics as advanced elements related to HTML, CSS, JS programming. The project was aimed at testing whether it is possible to write a reasonably working prototype in a short time and with two or three sessions.

## Assets

For educational purposes in the project I used original sprites from the Pokemon game, trying not to overdo it with cloning the content.

## Gameplay

As in every Pokemon game, here we also start our adventure as a Pokemon Trainer. We catch new creatures, challenge other trainers to fight, explore the region, earn badges and have fun. If someone has had contact with Pokemon games, mechanics will be familiar to him, and if someone meets for the first time, I recommend watching a short intro about Pokemon games.
